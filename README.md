Elantech touchpad N55 autostart
This are 2 scripts for right click touchpad.
Setting it to autostart
create a folder .autostart
move these 2 scripts inside it 
goto gnome-session-proprieties
add it to run, the first has to be "/home/username/.startup/enable-softbuttons.sh",
then do it too for the next one.
Remember the enable-softbuttons has to be the first one, no need to enter the xinput ID
since the script uses the device= "THE NAME OF THE DEVICE".
hope it helps.
Remember, these scripts are not mine, credits go to the owner who i don t know.
